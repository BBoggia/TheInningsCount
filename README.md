This was an application I developed in highschool for little leages to track the number of pitches each player on each team threw. It used Firebase as a backend and allowed league admins to create leagues and invite coaches to it. Anyone in the league could then view the stats at any time for any player in the league to verify they weren't over their pitching limit. 

I quit developing this app shortly after starting college due to lacking the time needed to maintain it.
